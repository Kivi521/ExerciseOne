                cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses
                from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.
                Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a
                sun drenched, tree-filled private garden.
                A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized
                bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind.
                Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy! An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to
                stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
                This is the perfect place for a home away from home.
